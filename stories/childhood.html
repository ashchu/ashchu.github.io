      <h1>When we grow up.</h1>
      <br>
      <p>I loved stories. Grew up with them. Read countless. Watched many more. And went through all the waves...Wattpad, Fanfics, John Greene, and complaining about film adaptations.'
        So naturally, I wanted my own life to be a picture I captured of sorts.</p>
      <p>
      Whenever someone asks about the <i>spark</i>
       or <i>key moment</i> where I knew I was interested in CS, I start with a story.
       </p>

       <p>I'm not sure what it was... maybe I should read through the now dusty notebooks somewhere cluttered on my shelf to find out... but I wanted an escape from the world. My perception of perfection started in either
         4th or 5th grade right near when my brother was growing fast and I was no longer the baby. My personality at the time was one geared towards perfection. I was trained on barbies and polly pockets to see that my
         idea of myself was to be a quirky, pretty, preferably blonde-haired, size 0 girl that lived luxuriously. Though, as a total aside... I did have that stereotypical experience where I eventually did steal my brother's LEGOs.
        </p>
       <p>
      So on this night at 4AM in the morning I had a realization on how my childhood favorite game actually influenced my life and decisions growing up.
       For a while, I would innocently share this story with others as it
       truly did inspire me and displaced me out of the real world and into a
       virtual realistic world where I could <i>be my true and best self</i>
       ... or what I thought that was. To you wonderful readers, I'll share this
       story again with calling out the systematic roles I learned through my favorite
       video game <b>Fantage</b>.
       <div class="note">Today Fantage is gone and although
         I do have mixed feelings towards this game today, I will say it was a huge highlight of my good ol' middle school years..</div>
       </p>


        <p>
          Fantage was my perfect world. Running home after school and zooming onto my dad's clunky HP laptop, I would log-in to ensure I could catch the latest styles, coins, outfits, and check-in with my friends.
          It was almost perfect. Here, I could be quirky, beautiful, and cool with the touch of a membership fee and a few connections you could become <i>popular</i>. A concept I never really fathomed in the real world.
